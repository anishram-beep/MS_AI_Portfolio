# Earnings Sentiment & Financial Signal Prediction (FinBERT)

## Overview
This project combines NLP and financial time-series modeling to predict post-earnings stock movement. The pipeline integrates FinBERT-based sentiment features with structured market features and ensemble models.

## Problem
Financial text contains useful information, but raw earnings call transcripts are noisy and difficult to convert into actionable predictive signals. The goal was to combine text sentiment with quantitative features to improve post-earnings direction prediction.

## Approach
I built an end-to-end workflow for:
- extracting and processing earnings text
- generating sentiment-related features
- combining those features with financial time-series data
- training ensemble models for prediction

## Methods and Tools
- Python
- FinBERT
- spaCy
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- NLP feature engineering

## Files
- `FinTextExtractor.ipynb` — text extraction workflow
- `GetStockData.ipynb` — financial data collection
- `SentimentClassifier.ipynb` — sentiment/modeling notebook
- `NLP_InvestmentGuidancePresentation.pptx` — presentation deck
- `.xlsx` files — supporting datasets and outputs

## Results
This project achieved 71% accuracy at a 28-day prediction horizon using an ensemble-based pipeline that fused text sentiment and financial features.

## Key Takeaways
- Built a full NLP + quantitative modeling workflow
- Demonstrated practical use of transformer-based sentiment in a financial setting
- Showed how unstructured text and structured signals can be combined for prediction

## How to Use
1. Start with `FinTextExtractor.ipynb`
2. Review `GetStockData.ipynb` for market data ingestion
3. Open `SentimentClassifier.ipynb` for modeling workflow
4. Review the presentation for a concise summary
